## Challanges faced:
       1. Add to Cart - While adding the products to the cart, which took a bit extra time for me.
       2. Date format - Formatting date really tooks a pity much time for me because of using it for the first time
       3. Add product from admin - While adding the new product to the existing products, after getting the old products i have missed a logic in the certain part. Later I have analyzed it and rectified.
       4. Most of the Challanges faced in logic side because of doing it for the first time.

## Todo

- Edit product from Admin side.
- Have to fix some minor bugs related to usability of code.
- Remove user if in need.
- Had to decorate the UI for better impression.
